# Capstone_Fall_2020

The purpose of a capstone design project is to provide us the opportunity to demonstrate understanding of the concepts they have learned during the course of their studies. In order to provide our students in the computer engineering area of specialization within the computer science department, embedded design experience which is so crucial to their education, we are requiring our students to do an embedded system project. This paper presents the details of four projects that the students have done in this capstone course.
